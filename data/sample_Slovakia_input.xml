The largest city is the capital, [[Bratislava]], and the second largest is [[Košice]]. Slovakia is a member state of the [[European Union]], Eurozone, [[Schengen Area]], [[NATO]], the [[United Nations]], the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] and the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]], among others.

The [[Slavs]]—ancestors of the Slovaks—arrived in the territory of present-day Slovakia in the 5th and 6th centuries during the [[migration period]]. In the 7th century, Slavs inhabiting this territory played a significant role in the creation of [[Samo]]'s Empire, historically the first Slavic state which had its center in Western Slovakia. During the 9th century, Slavic ancestors of the Slovaks established another political entity, the [[Principality of Nitra]], which later together with the Principality of Moravia, formed [[Great Moravia]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Slovakia}}

[[File:Moravianska venusa.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[Moravany Venus|Venus]] from [[Moravany nad Váhom]], which dates back to 22,800 BC.]]
[[Radiocarbon dating]] puts the oldest surviving archaeological artifacts from Slovakia – found near [[Nové Mesto nad Váhom]] – at 270,000&nbsp;BC, in the [[Lower Paleolithic|Early Paleolithic]] era. These ancient tools, made by the [[Clactonian|Clactonian technique]], bear witness to the ancient habitation of Slovakia.

Other [[stone tool]]s from the [[Middle Paleolithic|Middle Paleolithic era]] (200,000 – 80,000&nbsp;BC) come from the Prévôt (Prepoštská) cave near [[Bojnice]] and from other nearby sites.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://muzeumpraveku.sk/ |title=Museum of Prehistoric |first=|last=Museum of Prehistoric Prepoštská Cave|work=muzeumpraveku.sk |year=2011 |accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref> The most important discovery from that era is a [[Neanderthal]] [[human skull|cranium]] (c. 200,000 BC), discovered near [[Gánovce]], a village in northern Slovakia.

Archaeologists have found prehistoric human skeletons in the region, as well as numerous objects and vestiges of the [[Gravettian]] culture, principally in the river valleys of [[Nitra (river)|Nitra]], [[Hron]], [[Ipeľ]], [[Váh]] and as far as the city of [[Žilina]], and near the foot of the [[Vihorlat Mountains|Vihorlat]], Inovec, and [[Tribeč]] mountains, as well as in the [[Myjava]] Mountains. The most well-known finds include the oldest female statue made of [[mammoth]]-bone (22,800&nbsp;BC), the famous [[Venus of Moravany]]. The statue was found in the 1940s in [[Moravany nad Váhom]] near [[Piešťany]]. Numerous necklaces made of shells from Cypraca thermophile [[gastropoda|gastropods]] of the [[Tertiary|Tertiary period]] have come from the sites of Zákovská, Podkovice, Hubina, and Radošinare. These findings provide the most ancient evidence of commercial exchanges carried out between the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and Central Europe.

===Bronze age===
[[File:Web Biatec.jpg|thumb|Left: A [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Biatec]] coin<br/>Right: Five [[Slovak koruna|Slovak crowns]]]]
The [[Bronze Age]] in Slovakia went through three stages of development, stretching from 2000 to 800&nbsp;BC. <!--I am not sure what the following sentences mean, so I put them into this comment: To this there period belongs the well-known funeral culture of the Carpathians and that of the middle [[Danube]]. During the later Neolithic Age a considerable growth in cultural regions took place in Slovakia.--> Major cultural, economic, and political development can be attributed to the significant growth in production of copper, especially in central Slovakia (for example in [[Špania Dolina]]) and northwest Slovakia. Copper became a stable source of prosperity for the local population.

After the disappearance of the Čakany and [[Velatice]] cultures, the [[Lusatian culture|Lusatian]] people expanded building of strong and complex fortifications, with the large permanent buildings and administrative centers. Excavations of Lusatian [[hill fort]]s document the substantial development of trade and agriculture at that period. The richness and the diversity of tombs increased considerably. The inhabitants of the area manufactured arms, shields, jewelry, dishes, and statues.

===Iron age===

====Hallstatt Period====
The arrival of tribes from [[Thrace]] disrupted the people of the [[Kalenderberg culture]], who lived in the hamlets located on the plain ([[Sereď]]) and in the hill forts like Molpír, near [[Smolenice]], in the [[Little Carpathians]]. During Hallstatt times, monumental burial mounds were erected in western Slovakia, with princely equipment consisting of richly decorated vessels, ornaments and decorations. The burial rites consisted entirely of cremation. The common people were buried in flat urnfield cemeteries. A special role was given to weaving and the production of textiles. The local power of the "Princes" of the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt period]] disappeared in Slovakia during the last century before the middle of first millennium BCE, after strife between the [[Scythians|Scytho]]-Thracian people and locals, resulting in abandonment of the old hill-forts. Relatively depopulated areas soon caught interest of emerging [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes, who advanced from the south towards the north, following the Slovak rivers, peacefully integrating into the remnants of the local population.

====La Tène Period====
From around 500&nbsp;BC, the territory of modern-day Slovakia was settled by [[Celt]]s, who built powerful [[Enclosed oppidum|oppida]] on the sites of modern-day [[Bratislava]] and [[Devín|Devin]].  [[Biatec]]s, [[silver coin]]s with inscriptions in the Latin alphabet, represent the first known use of writing in Slovakia. At the northern regions, remnants of the local population of Lusatian origin, together with Celtic and later Dacian influence, gave rise to the unique [[Puchov culture]], with advanced crafts and iron-working, many hill-forts and fortified settlements of central type with coinage of the "Velkobysterecky" type (no inscriptions, with a horse on one side and a head on the other). This culture is often connected with the Celtic tribe mentioned in Roman sources as [[Cotini]].

====Roman Period====
From 2&nbsp;[[Anno Domini|AD]], the expanding [[Roman Empire]] established and maintained a series of outposts around and just north of the [[Danube]], the largest of which were known as [[Carnuntum]] (whose remains are on the main road halfway between Vienna and Bratislava) and Brigetio (present-day [[Szöny]] at the Slovak-Hungarian border). Such Roman border settlements were built on the present area of Rusovce, currently a suburb of Bratislava. The military fort was surrounded by a civilian vicus and several farms of the villa rustica type. The name of this settlement was [[Gerulata]]. The military fort had an auxiliary cavalry unit, approximately 300 horses strong, modeled after the [[Cananefates]]. The remains of Roman buildings have also survived in Devin castle (present-day downtown Bratislava), the suburbs of Dubravka and Stupava, and Bratislava Castle Hill.

[[File:Trencin-Roman2.JPG|thumb|A Roman inscription at the castle hill of [[Trenčín]] (178–179 AD).]]
Near the northernmost line of the Roman hinterlands, the [[Limes|Limes Romanus]], there existed the winter camp of [[Trenčín|Laugaricio]] (modern-day [[Trenčín]]) where the Auxiliary of Legion&nbsp;II fought and prevailed in a decisive battle over the Germanic [[Quadi]] tribe in 179&nbsp;AD during the [[Marcomannic Wars]]. The Kingdom of [[Vannius]], a kingdom founded by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Suebi]]an tribes of [[Quadi]] and [[Marcomanni]], as well as several small Germanic and [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic tribes]], including the Osi and [[Cotini]], existed in Western and Central Slovakia from 8–6&nbsp;BC to 179&nbsp;AD.

===Great invasions from the 4th to 7th centuries===
In the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, the [[Huns]] began to leave the Central Asian steppes. They crossed the Danube in 377&nbsp;AD and occupied [[Pannonia]], which they used for 75&nbsp;years as their base for launching looting-raids into Western Europe. However, Attila's death in 453 brought about the disappearance of the Hun tribe. In 568, a Turko-Mongol tribal confederacy, the [[European Avars|Avars]], conducted its own invasion into the Middle Danube region. The Avars occupied the lowlands of the [[Pannonian Plain]], and established an empire dominating the [[Pannonian Basin|Carpathian Basin]].

In 623, the Slavic population living in the western parts of Pannonia seceded from their empire after a revolution led by Samo, a Frankish merchant.<ref name='Történeti Kronológia'>{{cite book|last=Benda|first=Kálmán|title=Magyarország történeti kronológiája ''("The Historical Chronology of Hungary")''|publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó|year=1981|location=Budapest|page=44|isbn=963-05-2661-1}}</ref> After 626, the Avar power started a gradual decline<ref>Kristó, p.30–31</ref> but its reign lasted to 804.

===Slavic states===
The [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribes settled in the territory of present-day Slovakia in the 5th century. Western Slovakia was the centre of [[Samo|Samo's empire]] in the 7th century. A Slavic state known as the [[Principality of Nitra]] arose in the 8th century and its ruler [[Pribina]] had the first known Christian church of Slovakia consecrated by 828. Together with neighboring [[Moravia]], the principality formed the core of the [[Great Moravia|Great Moravian Empire]] from 833. The high point of this Slavonic empire came with the arrival of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] in 863, during the reign of Prince [[Rastislav]], and the territorial expansion under King [[Svatopluk I]].

===Great Moravia (830–before 907)===

Upon Rastislav's request, two brothers, Byzantine officials and missionaries [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] came in 863. [[Cyril]] developed the [[Glagolitic alphabet|first Slavic alphabet]] and translated the Gospel into the [[Old Church Slavonic]] language. Rastislav was also preoccupied with the security and administration of his state.

In 880, [[Pope John&nbsp;VIII]] set up an independent [[ecclesiastical province]] in Great Moravia with Archbishop [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Methodius]] as its head. He also named the German cleric [[Wiching]] the Bishop of [[Nitra]].

After the death of Prince Svatopluk in 894, his sons [[Mojmír&nbsp;II]] (894–906?) and [[Svatopluk&nbsp;II]] succeeded him as the Prince of Great Moravia and the Prince of Nitra respectively.<ref name='caplovic'/> However, they started to quarrel for domination of the whole empire.

We do not know what happened with both Mojmír&nbsp;II and Svatopluk&nbsp;II because they are not mentioned in written sources after 906. In [[Battle of Pressburg|three battles]] (4–5 July and 9 August 907) near [[Bratislava]], the Magyars routed [[Bavaria]]n armies. Some historians put this year as the date of the breakup of the Great Moravian Empire, due to the Hungarian conquest; other historians take the date a little bit earlier (to 902).

Great Moravia left behind a lasting legacy in Central and Eastern Europe. The [[Glagolitic alphabet|Glagolitic script]] and its successor [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] were disseminated to other Slavic countries, charting a new path in their [[Sociocultural evolution|sociocultural development]]. The administrative system of Great Moravia may have influenced the development of the administration of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Before the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s expansion into Hungary and the occupation of [[Buda]] in 1541, the capital of the Kingdom of Hungary (under the name of [[Royal Hungary]]) moved to Pressburg (in {{lang-sk|Prešporok}} at that time, currently Bratislava). Pressburg became the capital city of the Royal Hungary in 1536. But the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman wars]] and frequent insurrections against the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] also inflicted a great deal of devastation, especially in the rural areas.<ref>"[http://www.slovakiasite.com/history-hungary.php Part of Hungary, Turkish occupation]".

===Czechoslovakia (1918–1939)===
{{Main|Czechoslovakia}}
[[File:Masaryk a Štefánik.jpg|thumb|150px|left|A monument to [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]] and [[Milan Rastislav Štefánik|Milan Štefánik]] - both key figures in early Czechoslovakia]]
In 1918, Slovakia and the regions of [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], [[Czech Silesia|Silesia]] and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] formed a common state, [[Czechoslovakia]], with the borders confirmed by the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint Germain]] and [[Treaty of Trianon]]. In 1919, during the chaos following the breakup of Austria-Hungary, Czechoslovakia was formed with numerous Germans and Hungarians within the newly set borders. A Slovak patriot [[Milan Rastislav Štefánik]] (1880–1919), who helped organize Czechoslovak regiments against Austria-Hungary during the First World War, died in a plane crash. In the peace following the World War, Czechoslovakia emerged as a sovereign European state. It provided what were at the time rather extensive rights to its minorities and remained the only democracy in this part of Europe in the interwar period.

During the [[Interwar period]], democratic Czechoslovakia was allied with France, and also with [[Romania]] and [[Yugoslavia]] ([[Little Entente]]); however, the [[Locarno Treaties]] of 1925 left East European security open. Both Czechs and Slovaks enjoyed a period of relative prosperity.  There was progress in not only the development of the country's economy, but also culture and educational opportunities. The minority Germans came to accept their role in the new country and relations with Austria were good. Yet the [[Great Depression]] caused a sharp economic downturn, followed by political disruption and insecurity in Europe.<ref>J.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;Polisencky, ''History of Czechoslovakia in Outline'' (Prague: Bohemia International 1947) at 113–114.</ref>

Thereafter Czechoslovakia came under continuous pressure from the [[Revanchism|revisionist]] governments of Germany and Hungary. Eventually this led to the [[Munich Agreement]] of September 1938, which allowed Nazi Germany to partially dismember the country by occupying what was called the [[Sudetenland]], a region with a German-speaking majority and bordering Germany and Austria. The remainder of "rump" Czechoslovakia was renamed [[Czecho-Slovakia]] and included a greater degree of Slovak political autonomy. Southern and eastern Slovakia, however, was reclaimed by Hungary at the [[First Vienna Award]] of November 1938.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

After the Munich Agreement and its [[Vienna Awards|Vienna Award]], [[Nazi Germany]] threatened to annex part of Slovakia and allow the remaining regions to be partitioned by Hungary or Poland unless independence was declared. Thus, Slovakia seceded from Czecho-Slovakia in March 1939 and allied itself, as demanded by Germany, with [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's]] coalition.<ref>Gerhard L.

After it became clear that the Soviet [[Red Army]] was going to push the Nazis out of eastern and central Europe, an anti-Nazi [[resistance movement]] launched a fierce armed insurrection, known as the [[Slovak National Uprising]], near the end of summer 1944. A bloody German occupation and a guerilla war followed. The territory of Slovakia was liberated by Soviet and Romanian forces by the end of April 1945.

Czechoslovakia came under the influence of the Soviet Union and its [[Warsaw Pact]] after a coup in 1948. The country was [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|occupied]] by the Warsaw Pact forces (with the exception of [[Romania]]) in 1968, ending a [[Prague Spring|period of liberalization]] under the leadership of [[Alexander Dubček]].

===Establishment of the Slovak Republic (1992-)===
The end of Communist rule in Czechoslovakia in 1989, during the peaceful [[Velvet Revolution]], was followed once again by the country's dissolution, this time into two [[succession of states|successor states]]. In July 1992 Slovakia, led by Prime Minister [[Vladimír Mečiar]], declared itself a sovereign state, meaning that its laws took precedence over those of the federal government. Throughout the autumn of 1992, Mečiar and [[List of Prime Ministers of the Czech Republic|Czech Prime Minister]] [[Václav Klaus]] negotiated the details for disbanding the federation. In November the federal parliament voted to dissolve the country officially on 31 December 1992.

The Slovak Republic and the [[Czech Republic]] went their separate ways after 1 January 1993, an event sometimes called the [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|Velvet Divorce]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slovakia.org/history-topics |title=The Breakup of Czechoslovakia |publisher=Slovakia |accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/velvet+divorce |title=Velvet divorce |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref> Slovakia has remained a close partner with the Czech Republic. Both countries cooperate with Hungary and Poland in the [[Visegrád Group]]. Slovakia became a member of NATO on 29 March 2004 and of the European Union on 1 May 2004. On 1 January 2009, Slovakia adopted the Euro as its national currency.

==Geography==
[[File:Slovakia topo.jpg|thumb|350px|A [[topography|topographic]] map of Slovakia.]]
{{Main|Geography of Slovakia}}
{{See also|Geomorphological division of Slovakia}}
Slovakia lies between latitudes [[47th parallel north|47°]] and [[50th parallel north|50° N]], and longitudes [[16th meridian east|16°]] and [[23rd meridian east|23° E]].

The Slovak landscape is noted primarily for its mountainous nature, with the [[Carpathian Mountains]] extending across most of the northern half of the country. Amongst these [[mountain range]]s are the high peaks of the [[Fatra-Tatra Area]] (including [[Tatra mountains]], [[Greater Fatra]] and [[Lesser Fatra]]), [[Slovak Ore Mountains]], [[Slovak Central Mountains]] or [[Beskids]]. The largest lowland is the fertile [[Danubian Lowland]] in the southwest, followed by the [[Eastern Slovak Lowland]] in the southeast.<ref name=cia>{{cite web |title= Slovakia |work= The World Factbook |publisher= [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] |year=2007 |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/lo.html |accessdate=26 April 2008}}</ref>

===Tatra mountains===
{{Main|Tatra mountains}}
[[Tatra Mountains|Tatras]], with 29 peaks higher than {{convert|2500|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} [[AMSL]], are the highest mountain range in the Carpathian Mountains. Tatras occupy an area of {{convert|750|km²|0|abbr=out}}, of which the greater part {{convert|600|km²|0|abbr=out}} lies in Slovakia. They are divided into several parts.

To the north, close to the Polish border, are the [[High Tatras]] which are a popular [[hiking]] and [[skiing]] destination and home to many scenic lakes and valleys as well as the highest point in Slovakia, the [[Gerlachovský štít]] at {{convert|2655|m|ft|0}} and the country's highly symbolic mountain [[Kriváň (peak)|Kriváň]]. To the west are the [[Western Tatras]] with their highest peak of [[Rysy]] at {{convert|2503|m|ft|0}} and to the east are the [[Belianske Tatras]], smallest by area.

Separated from the Tatras proper by the valley of the [[Váh]] river are the [[Low Tatras]], with their highest peak of [[Ďumbier]] at {{convert|2043|m|ft|0}}.

The Tatra mountain range is represented as one of the three hills on the [[coat of arms of Slovakia]].

===Caves===
{{Main|List of caves in Slovakia}}
[[File:Ochtina Aragonite Cave 27.jpg|thumb|right| [[Ochtinska Aragonite Cave]]]] 
Slovakia has hundreds of caves and caverns under its mountains, out of which 15 are open to the public. Most of the caves have stalagmites rising from the ground and stalactites hanging from above. There are currently five Slovak caves under [[UNESCO]]'s World Heritage Site status. They are [[Dobšinská Ice Cave]], [[Domica]], [[Gombasek Cave]], [[Jasovská Cave]] and [[Ochtinská Aragonite Cave]]. Other caves open to public include [[Belianska Cave]], [[Demänovská Cave of Liberty]], [[Demänovská Ice Cave]] or [[Bystrianska Cave]]

===Rivers===
{{Main|List of rivers of Slovakia}}

Most of the rivers stem in Slovak mountains. Some are only passing through and the others make a natural border with surrounding countries (more than {{convert|620|km|mi|0}}). For example [[Dunajec]] ({{convert|17|km|mi|0}}) to the north, [[Danube River|Danube]] ({{convert|172|km|mi|0}}) to the south or [[Morava (river)|Morava]] ({{convert|119|km|mi|0}}) to the West. The total length of the rivers on Slovak territory is {{convert|49774|km|mi|0}}.

The longest river in Slovakia is [[Vah River|Váh]] ({{convert|403|km|mi|0}}), the shortest is  Čierna voda. Other important and large rivers are [[Myjava (river)|Myjava]], [[Nitra (river)|Nitra]] ({{convert|197|km|mi|0}}), [[Orava (river)|Orava]], [[Hron]] ({{convert|298|km|mi|0}}), [[Hornád]] ({{convert|193|km|mi|0}}), [[Sajó|Slaná]] ({{convert|110|km|mi|0}}), [[Ipeľ]] ({{convert|232|km|mi|0}}, making the border with Hungary), [[Bodrog]], [[Laborec]], [[Latorica]] and [[Ondava]].

The biggest volume of discharge in Slovak rivers is during [[Spring (season)|spring]], when the snow is melting from the mountains. The only exception is Danube, whose discharge is the biggest during summer when the snow is melting in the [[Alps mountains|Alps]]. Danube is the largest river that flows through Slovakia.<ref>{{cite web|author=Nie ste prihlásený. |url=http://www.slovakregion.sk/vodstvo-jazera-rieky-rybniky-slovenska |title=Translated from Slovak language |publisher=Slovakregion.sk |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref>

===Lakes===
[[File:Strbske pleso slovakia.jpg|thumb|right| [[Štrbské pleso]] natural lake is a popular tourist destination in the High Tatras]]
There are around 175 naturally formed [[Tarn (lake)|tarns]] in [[High Tatras]]. With an area of 20 ha and its depth of {{convert|53|m|ft|0}}, [[Veľké Hincovo pleso]] is the largest and the deepest tarn in Slovakia. Other tarns in the High Tatras include [[Štrbské pleso]], [[Popradské pleso]], [[Skalnaté pleso]], [[Zbojnícke pleso]], [[Velické pleso]], [[Žabie pleso]], [[Krivánske zelené pleso]] or [[Roháčske plesá]]. Other than in the High Tatras there are [[Vrbické pleso]] in [[Low Tatras]], [[Morské oko (Slovakia)|Morské oko]] and [[Vinné jazero]] in [[Vihorlat Mountains]] or [[Jezerské jazero]] in [[Spišská Magura]].

The largest dams on the river Váh are [[Liptovská Mara]] and [[Sĺňava]]. Other well known dams are [[Oravská priehrada]] in the north, [[Zemplínska Šírava]] and [[Domaša]] in the east, [[Senecké jazerá]], [[Zlaté piesky]] or [[Zelená voda]] in the west.

===Climate===
The Slovak climate lies between the temperate and [[continental climate]] zones with relatively warm summers and cold, cloudy and humid winters. Temperature extremes are in interval between {{convert|-41|to|40.3|C|F|1}} although temperatures below {{convert|-30|°C|0}} are rare. The weather differs from the mountainous North to the plain South.

The warmest region is [[Bratislava]] and Southern Slovakia where the temperatures may rise up to {{convert|30|°C|0|abbr=on}} in summer, occasionally to {{convert|37|°C|0|abbr=on}}. During night, the temperatures rise up to {{convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on}}. The daily temperatures in winter average in the range of {{convert|-5|°C|0|abbr=on}} up to {{convert|10|°C|0|abbr=on}}. During night it may be freezing, but usually not below {{convert|-10|°C|0|abbr=on}}.

Summer in Northern Slovakia is usually mild with temperatures around {{convert|25|°C|0|abbr=on}} (less in the mountains). Winters are colder in the mountains, where the snow usually lasts until March and April and the night temperatures go down to {{convert|-20|°C|0|abbr=on}} and colder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slovensko.com/about/weather-climate |title=Based on the "Climate" article from |publisher=www.slovensko.com |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref>

==Biodiversity==
Slovakia signed the Rio [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] on 19 May 1993, and became a party to the convention on 25 August 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/convention/parties/list/ |title=List of Parties |accessdate=8 December 2012}}</ref> It has subsequently produced a [[Biodiversity action plan|National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan]], which was received by the convention on 2 November 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/doc/world/sk/sk-nbsap-01-p1-en.pdf |title=National Biodiversity Strategy of Slovakia |accessdate=8 December 2012}}</ref>

The biodiversity of Slovakia comprises animals (such as annellids, arthropods, molluscs, nematodes and vertebrates), fungi ([[Ascomycota]], [[Basidiomycota]], [[Chytridiomycota]], [[Glomeromycota]] and [[Zygomycota]]), micro-organisms (including [[Mycetozoa]]), and plants.

Slovakia is a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democratic]] republic with a [[multi-party system]]. The last [[Slovak parliamentary election, 2012|parliamentary elections]] were held on 10 March 2012 and two rounds of [[Slovak presidential election, 2014|presidential elections]] took place on 15 and 29 March 2014.

The Slovak [[head of state]] is the president (currently [[Andrej Kiska]]), elected by direct popular vote for a five-year term. Most [[executive (government)|executive]] power lies with the [[head of government]], the prime minister (currently [[Robert Fico]]), who is usually the leader of the winning party, but he/she needs to form a majority coalition in the parliament. The prime minister is appointed by the president. The remainder of the cabinet is appointed by the president on the recommendation of the prime minister.

Slovakia's highest [[legislature|legislative]] body is the 150-seat [[unicameralism|unicameral]] [[National Council of the Slovak Republic]] (''Národná rada Slovenskej republiky''). Delegates are elected for a four-year term on the basis of [[proportional representation]]. Slovakia's highest [[judiciary|judicial body]] is the [[Constitutional Court of Slovakia]] (''Ústavný súd''), which rules on constitutional issues. The 13&nbsp;members of this court are appointed by the president from a slate of candidates nominated by parliament.

Slovakia has been a member state of the European Union and [[NATO]] since 2004. As a member of the United Nations (since 1993), Slovakia was, on 10 October 2005, elected to a two-year term on the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] from 2006 to 2007. Slovakia is also a member of WTO, OECD, [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], and other international organizations.

The [[Constitution of Slovakia|Constitution of the Slovak Republic]] was ratified 1 September 1992, and became effective 1 January 1993). It was amended in September 1998 to allow [[direct election]] of the president and again in February 2001 due to EU admission requirements.
The [[civil law (legal system)|civil law system]] is based on Austro-Hungarian codes. The [[code (law)|legal code]] was modified to comply with the obligations of [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE) and to expunge the [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] [[Law|legal theory]]. Slovakia accepts the compulsory [[International Court of Justice]] jurisdiction with reservations.

The president is the head of state and the formal head of the executive, though with very limited powers. The president is elected by direct, popular vote under the [[two-round system]] for a five-year term.

Following National Council elections, the leader of the [[Two-party system|majority party]] or the leader of the majority coalition is usually appointed prime minister by the president. Cabinet appointed by the president on the recommendation of the prime minister has to receive the majority in the parliament.

{{Main|Foreign relations of Slovakia}}

Slovakia has been a member of [[European Union]] since 2004. Slovakia has been an active participant in U.S.- and NATO-led military actions. There is a joint Czech-Slovak peacekeeping force in Kosovo.

Slovakia is a member of the [[United Nations]] and participates in its specialized agencies. It is a member of the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE), the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), and the [[OECD]]. It also is part of the [[Visegrad Four]] (Slovakia, [[Hungary]], [[Czech Republic]], and [[Poland]]), a forum for discussing areas of common concern.

The Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic entered into a [[Customs Union]] upon the division of Czechoslovakia in 1993, which facilitates a relatively free flow of goods and services. Slovakia maintains [[diplomacy|diplomatic relations]] with 134 countries, primarily through its [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Slovakia)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]. There are 44 embassies and 35 honorary consulates in [[Bratislava]].

===Human rights===
{{Main|Human rights in Slovakia}}
The U.S. State Department in 2010 reported:
:"The government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; however, there were problems in some areas. Notable human rights problems included some continuing reports of police mistreatment of Romani suspects and lengthy pretrial detention; restrictions on freedom of religion; concerns about the integrity of the judiciary, corruption in national government, local government, and government health services; violence against women and children; trafficking in women and children; and societal discrimination and violence against Roma and other minorities."<ref>U.S. Dept. of State, [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/eur/136057.htm "2009 Human Rights Report: Slovakia" 11 March 2010]</ref>

Human rights in Slovakia are guaranteed by the [[Constitution of Slovakia]] from the year 1992 and by multiple international laws signed in Slovakia between 1948 and 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mzv.sk/servlet/content?MT=/App/WCM/main.nsf/vw_ByID/zahranicna__politika&TG=BlankMaster&URL=/App/WCM/main.nsf/vw_ByID/medzinarodne_zmluvy-zmluvy_podla_predmetu&CTYPE=%C4%BDudsk%C3%A9%20pr%C3%A1va&OpenDocument=Y&LANG=SK&PAGE_VSETKYZMLUVY-DWMCEA-7XEM76=1 |title=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Slovakia – list of international acts relating to human rights |publisher=Mzv.sk |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref> Slovakia [[Slovak nationality law|excludes multiple citizenships]].

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Regions of Slovakia|Districts of Slovakia}}
As for [[administrative division]], Slovakia is subdivided into 8 ''[[kraj]]ov'' (singular – ''kraj'', usually translated as "region"), each of which is named after its principal city. Regions have enjoyed a certain degree of autonomy since 2002. Their [[Self-governance|self-governing]] bodies are referred to as Self-governing (or autonomous) Regions (sg. ''samosprávny kraj'', pl. ''samosprávne kraje'') or Upper-Tier Territorial Units (sg. ''vyšší územný celok'', pl. ''vyššie územné celky'', abbr. VÚC).

The "kraje" are subdivided into many ''[[okres]]ov'' (sg. ''okres'', usually translated as districts). Slovakia currently has 79&nbsp;districts.

In terms of economics and [[unemployment|unemployment rate]], the western regions are richer than eastern regions; however the relative difference is no bigger than in most EU countries having regional differences.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Slovakia}}

[[File:Slovakia Export Treemap.png|thumb|upright|350px|A graphical depiction of Slovakia's product exports in 28 color-coded categories.]]
[[File:Eurozone.svg|thumb|upright|Slovakia is part of the [[Schengen Area]], the EU single market, and since 2009, the [[Eurozone]] (dark blue)]]

The Slovak economy is considered an [[Developed country|advanced economy]], with the country dubbed the "[[Tatra Tiger]]". Slovakia transformed from a centrally [[planned economy]] to a market-driven economy. Major [[privatization]]s are nearly complete, the banking sector is almost completely in private hands, and foreign investment has risen.

Before the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]], Slovakia had experienced high and sustained economic growth. In 2007 (with [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] growth of 10.5%), 2008 (6%) and 2010 (with 4%), Slovakia was the fastest growing economy in the [[European Union]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/european_economy/2012/pdf/ee-2012-1_en.pdf |title=Statistical data and prediction of the European Commission |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref> In 2011 (with the GDP growth of 3.3%) and 2012 (GDP growth of 1.8%), Slovakia was the 2nd fastest growing [[Eurozone]] member after [[Estonia]]. Slovakia's GDP growth of 0.9% in 2013 remains one of the highest in the [[Eurozone]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&init=1&plugin=1&language=en&pcode=tec00115 |title=Real GDP growth rate - volume |accessdate=2014-01-20}}</ref>

The ratio of government debt to GDP in Slovakia reached 58% by the end of 2013.<ref>http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/2-23102013-AP/EN/2-23102013-AP-EN.PDF</ref>

Unemployment, peaking at 19% at the end of 1999, decreased to 7.5% in October 2008 according to the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iii.co.uk/news/?type=afxnews&articleid=6608367&subject=companies&action=article |title=Slovak unemployment falls to 7.8% in Feb from Jan from Thomson Financial News Limited |publisher=Iii.co.uk |accessdate=16 October 2010}}</ref> In addition to economic growth, migration of workers to other EU countries also contributed to this reduction. According to [[Eurostat]], which uses a calculation method different from that of the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic, the unemployment rate in September 2012 is at 13.9% <ref>{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/5/5e/Unemployment_rates%2C_seasonally_adjusted%2C_September_2012.png |title=Eurostat graph of unemployment in Europe Sep. 2012 |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref> the third highest in the Eurozone (after Spain and Portugal).

Inflation dropped from an average annual rate of 12% in 2000 to just 3.3% in 2002, an election year, but it rose again in 2003–2004 because of rising labor costs and taxes. It reached only 1% in 2010 which is the lowest recorded rate since 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ako-investovat.sk/index.php/inflacia-na-slovensku |title=Inflation in Slovakia since 1993 |publisher=Ako-investovat.sk |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref> The rate was at 4% in 2011.

Slovakia adopted the Euro currency on 1 January 2009 as the 16th member of the Eurozone. The euro in Slovakia was approved by [[European Commission|the European commission]] on 7 May 2008. The [[Slovak koruna]] was revalued on 28 May 2008 to 30.126 for 1 euro,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/feedarticle/7546478|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080601034210/http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/feedarticle/7546478|archivedate=1 June 2008|title=Slovakia revalues currency ahead of euro entry|first=Marcin|last=Grajewski|work=The Guardian|date=28 May 2008|accessdate=9 July 2010}}</ref> which was also the exchange rate for the euro.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7495169.stm|title=Slovak euro exchange rate is set|publisher=BBC News|date=8 July 2008|accessdate=9 July 2010}}</ref>

Slovakia is an attractive country for [[Investment|foreign investors]] mainly because of its low wages, low tax rates and well educated [[labor force|labour force]]. In recent years, Slovakia has been pursuing a policy of encouraging foreign investment. [[foreign direct investment|FDI]] inflow grew more than 600% from 2000 and cumulatively reached an all-time high of $17.3&nbsp;billion in 2006, or around $22,000 per capita by the end of 2008.

Despite a sufficient number of researchers{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} and a decent secondary [[education in Slovakia|educational system]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Slovakia, along with other [[Post-Communism|post-communist]] countries, still faces major challenges in the field of the [[knowledge economy]]. The business and public [[research and development]] expenditures are well below the EU average. The [[Programme for International Student Assessment]], coordinated by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], currently ranks Slovak secondary education the 30th in the world (placing it just below the United States and just above Spain).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/42/8/39700724.pdf |title=Range of rank on the PISA 2006 science scale at OECD |format=PDF |accessdate=16 October 2010}}</ref>

In March 2008, the Ministry of Finance announced that Slovakia's economy is developed enough to stop being an aid receiver from the [[World Bank]]. Slovakia became an aid provider at the end of 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tasr.sk/30.axd?k=20080312TBB00600 |title=Slovakia Is Sufficiently Developled to Offer Aid Within World Bank at TASR |publisher=Tasr.sk |accessdate=16 October 2010}}{{dead link|date=September 2013}}</ref>

===Industry===
Although Slovakia's GDP comes mainly from the tertiary (services) sector, the industrial sector also plays an important role within its economy. The main industry sectors are [[Automobile|car]] manufacturing and [[electrical engineering]]. Since 2007, Slovakia has been the world's largest producer of cars per capita,<ref name=Kia>{{cite web|url=http://www.industryweek.com/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=16083 |title=Slovak Car Industry Production Almost Doubled in 2007 |publisher=Industryweek.com |date=9 April 2008 |accessdate=16 October 2010}}</ref> with a total of 571,071 cars manufactured in the country in 2007 alone.<ref name=Kia/> There are currently three automobile assembly plants: [[Volkswagen]]'s in [[Bratislava]], [[PSA Peugeot Citroën]]'s in [[Trnava]] and [[Kia Motors]]' [[Kia Design and Manufacturing Facilities#Žilina Plant|Žilina Plant]].

From electrical engineering companies, [[Sony]] has a factory at [[Nitra]] for [[LCD television|LCD TV]] manufacturing, [[Samsung Group|Samsung]] at [[Galanta]] for [[computer monitor]]s and television sets manufacturing.

ESET is an IT security company from Bratislava with more than 500 employees worldwide at present. Their branch offices are in the United States, [[Ireland]], United Kingdom, [[Argentina]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Singapore]] and [[Poland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eset.com/me/about/profile/history/|title=About ESET: Company Profile: History|publisher=ESET|accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref>

===Energy===

In 2012, Slovakia produced a total of 28 393 [[Gigawatt-hour|GWh]] of [[electricity]] while at the same time consumed 28 786 GWh. The slightly higher level of consumption than the capacity of production (- 393 GWh) meant the country was not self-sufficient in energy sourcing. Slovakia imported electricity mainly from the [[Czech Republic]] (9 961 GWh - 73.6% of total import) and exported mainly to [[Hungary]] (10 231 GWh - 78.2% of total export).

[[Nuclear power|Nuclear energy]] accounts for 53.8% of total electricity production in Slovakia, followed by 18.1% of [[Thermal power station|thermal power]] energy, 15.1% by [[hydro power]] energy, 2% by [[solar energy]], 9.6% by other sources and the rest 1.4% is imported.<ref>{{cite web|work=Electricity consumption / production in Slovakia in 2012|url=http://www.sepsas.sk/seps/dokumenty/RocenkySed/Rocenka_SED_2012.pdf|title=National Control Centre of Slovakia|year=2013|accessdate=3 October 2013|language=Slovak, English}}</ref>

The two nuclear power-plants in Slovakia are in [[Jaslovské Bohunice Nuclear Power Plant|Jaslovské Bohunice]] and [[Mochovce Nuclear Power Plant|Mochovce]], each of them containing two operating reactors. Prior to the accession of Slovakia to the EU in 2004, the government agreed to turn-off the V1 block of [[Jaslovské Bohunice Nuclear Power Plant|Jaslovské Bohunice power-plant]], built by [[Soviet Union]] in 1978. After deactivating the last of the two reactors of the V1 block in 2008, Slovakia instantly stopped being self-dependent in energy production. Currently there is another block (V2) with two active reactors in [[Jaslovské Bohunice Nuclear Power Plant|Jaslovské Bohunice]]. It is scheduled for decommissioning in 2025. The nuclear power production in Slovakia sometimes draws attention to [[Austria]]n green-energy activists who occasionally organize protests and block the borders between the two countries.

===Transportation===

There are four main highways D1 to D4 and eight express ways R1 to R8. Most of them are still in the planning phase.

The [[Motorway D1 (Slovakia)|D1 motorway]] connects Bratislava to [[Trnava]], [[Nitra]], [[Trenčín]], [[Žilina]] and beyond, while the [[Motorway D2 (Slovakia)|D2 motorway]] connects it to [[Prague]], [[Brno]] and [[Budapest]] in the north-south direction. The [[Motorway D4 (Slovakia)|D4&nbsp;motorway]] (an outer bypass), which would ease the pressure on Bratislava's highway system, is mostly at the planning stage.

The [[Nordostautobahn|A6&nbsp;motorway]] to [[Vienna]] connects Slovakia directly to the Austrian motorway system and was opened on 19 November 2007.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Pravda (Slovakia)|Pravda]]|url=http://www.tvojepeniaze.sk/do-viedne-uz-netreba-ist-po-okresnej-ceste-fgy-/sk_pludia.asp?c=A071119_072754_sk_pludia_p01|title=Do Viedne už netreba ísť po okresnej ceste|year=2007|accessdate=19 November 2007|language=Slovak}}</ref>

In Bratislava there are currently five bridges standing over the [[Danube]] (ordered by the flow of the river): [[Lafranconi Bridge]], [[Nový Most]] (The New Bridge), [[Starý most (Bratislava)|Starý most]] (The Old Bridge), [[Apollo Bridge|Most Apollo]] and [[Prístavný most]] (The Harbor Bridge).

The city's inner network of roadways is made on the radial-circular shape. Nowadays, the city experiences a sharp increase in the road traffic, increasing pressure on the road network. There are about 200,000 registered cars in Bratislava, (approximately 2 inhabitants per car).<ref name="transport"/>

Bratislava's [[M.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;Štefánik Airport]] is the main [[international airport]] in Slovakia. It is located 9&nbsp;kilometres (5.59 [[Mile|mi]]) northeast of the city centre. It serves civil and governmental, scheduled and unscheduled domestic and international flights. The current runways support the landing of all common types of aircraft currently used. The airport has enjoyed rapidly growing passenger traffic in recent years; it served 279,028&nbsp;passengers in 2000, 1,937,642 in 2006 and 2,024,142 in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|work=Letisko M.R.

The [[Port of Bratislava]] is one of the two international [[port|river ports]] in Slovakia. The port connects Bratislava to international boat traffic, especially the interconnection from the [[North Sea]] to the [[Black Sea]] via the [[Rhine–Main–Danube Canal|Rhine-Main-Danube Canal]].
Additionally, tourist lines operate from Bratislava's passenger port, including routes to [[Devín]], [[Vienna]] and elsewhere.

Typical souvenirs from Slovakia are dolls dressed in folk costumes, ceramic objects, crystal glass, carved wooden figures, [[črpák]]s (wooden pitchers), [[fujara]]s (a [[folk instrument]] on the UNESCO list) and [[valaška]]s (a decorated folk hatchet) and above all products made from [[husk|corn husks]] and wire, notably human figures.

Souvenirs can be bought in the shops run by the state organization ÚĽUV (''Ústredie ľudovej umeleckej výroby'' – Center of [[Folk art|Folk Art]] Production). ''Dielo'' shop chain sells works of Slovak artists and craftsmen. These shops are mostly found in towns and cities.

Prices of imported products are generally the same as in the neighboring countries, whereas prices of local products and services, especially food, are usually lower.

===Science===
The [[Slovak Academy of Sciences]] has been the most important scientific and research institution in the country since 1953. Slovaks have made notable scientific and technical contributions during the history. The list of important scientists and their inventions include:

[[File:Bodruzal cerkov06017008.JPG||thumb|This wooden church in [[Bodružal]] is an example of Slovak folk architecture and is a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].]]

[[Folk]] tradition has rooted strongly in Slovakia and is reflected in literature, music, dance and architecture. The prime example is a Slovak national anthem, ''"[[Nad Tatrou sa blýska]]"'', which is based on a melody from ''"[[Kopala studienku]]"'' folk song.

Manifestation of Slovak folklore culture is the "''Východná''" Folklore Festival. It is the oldest and largest nationwide festival with international participation,<ref>{{cite web|title="Východná" festival|url=http://www.festivalvychodna.sk/en/}}</ref> which takes place in [[Východná]] annually. Slovakia is usually represented by many groups but mainly by SĽUK (''Slovenský ľudový umelecký kolektív - Slovak folk art collective''). SĽUK is the largest Slovak folk art group, trying to preserve the folklore tradition.

An example of wooden folk architecture in Slovakia can be seen in the well preserved village of [[Vlkolínec]] which has been the [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] since 1993.<ref>{{cite web|title=UNESCO information about Vlkolínec|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/622}}</ref> Eastern part of Slovakia, particularly the region of [[Spiš]], preserves the world's most remarkable folk wooden churches. Most of them are protected by Slovak law as [[cultural heritage]], but some of them are on the [[UNESCO]] list too, in Bodružal, Hervartov, Ladomirová and Ruská Bystrá.

The best known Slovak hero, found in many folk [[mythologies]], is [[Juraj Jánošík]] (1688–1713) (the Slovak equivalent of [[Robin Hood]]). The legend says he was taking from the rich and giving to the poor. Jánošík's life was depicted in a list of literature works and many movies throughout the 20th century. One of the most popular is a [[film]] ''Jánošík'' directed by [[Martin Frič]] in 1935.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jánošík movie on Czechoslovak Film Database|year=1935|url=http://www.csfd.cz/film/3113-janosik/}}</ref>

===Art===
[[Visual art]] in Slovakia is represented through [[painting]], [[drawing]], [[printmaking]], [[illustration]], [[Handicraft|arts and crafts]], [[sculpture]], [[photography]] or [[conceptual art]].

Well known sculptor of the 15th century Late [[Gothic art|Gothic]] era in Slovakia is the ''[[Master Paul of Levoča]]''. Although his work can be found in many places ([[Banská Bystrica]], [[Spišská Sobota]] or Lomnička), his most famous is a wooden [[altar]] in the Church of St. Jacob in [[Levoča]]. With its height of {{convert|18.62|m|ft|0}}, it is the tallest Gothic altar in the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=Altar information from the official portal of St. Jacob church in Levoča|url=http://www.chramsvjakuba.sk/en.html#hosjakuba}}</ref> Well known painters of that time are the ''Master from Okoličné'', author of the altar in [[St. Elisabeth Cathedral]] in [[Košice]], and ''[[Master MS|Master M.S.]]'' of the 16th century, whose statue of Madonna can be seen in the Saint Catherine Church in [[Banská Štiavnica]]. The statues of Saint Catherine and Saint Barbara are in the art gallery of the Slovak Mining Museum in Banská Štiavnica.

'''19th century'''

The 19th century in Slovakia was a turbulent period of time when Slovaks began experiencing their national revival in the kingdom of [[Austria-Hungary]]. [[Romanticism]] of [[Jozef B. Klemens]] (1817–1883) and [[Peter Michal Bohúň]] (1822–1879) was represented in the portrait paintings of Slovak national protagonists of that time (Štefan Moyses, [[Andrej Sládkovič]], Karol Kuzmány or [[Ľudovít Štúr]]), depicting the revolutionary atmosphere of the 1840s in the background. Other important painters of the 19th century were mainly [[portraitist]]s Vojtech Angyal, Dominik Skutecký (1849–1921), J. Štetka, E. Ballo, Jozef Hanula (1863 – 1944), [[landscapist]] Karol Miloslav Lehotský (1846 – 1915) and [[impressionist]]s [[Maximilián Schurmann]] (1863 – 1944) and P. Kern.

[[Sculpture]] in the 19th century was dominated by a sacral sculptor Vavrinec Dunajský (1784 – 1833) and his son Ladislav Dunajský, author of [[Ján Hollý]] memorial in [[Dobrá Voda, Trnava District|Dobrá Voda]]. Another important sculptors were [[Ján Koniarek]] (1878 – 1952), [[Alojz Stróbl]] (1856 – 1926), [[Ján Fadrusz]] (1858 – 1903) and [[Alojz Rigele]] (1879–1940).

'''20th century'''
[[File:150px-Mother Galanda.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mikuláš Galanda]] - ''Mother'' (1933)]]

Painters [[Mikuláš Galanda]] (1895–1938), [[Martin Benka]] (1888–1971), [[Janko Alexy]] (1894–1970), [[Miloš Alexander Bazovský]] (1899–1968), [[Gustáv Mallý]] (1879–1952) and [[Jan Hála]] (1890–1959) are considered to be the ones who laid foundations of the Slovak [[modern art]] in the first half of the 20th century. The inspiration of their work stems mainly from the lives of everyday people in Slovak [[rural area|rurals]] which they admired and idealized. The painters influenced by [[Art Nouveau]], [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] and [[expressionism]] are Zolo Palugyay (1898 – 1935), Anton Jasusch (1882–1965), [[Edmund Gwerk]] (1895–1956) or [[Július Jakoby]] (1903 – 1985). Important also is [[Blažej Baláž]] (1958).

Some of the most distinguished Slovak artists, whose work was closely linked to modern European art streams are [[Koloman Sokol]] (1902 – 2003), who became a professor of graphic techniques at the ''Escuela de las Artes del Libro'' and at the University of [[Mexico City]] from 1937 to 1941, [[Ľudovít Fulla]] (1902 – 1980) who received many international prices for his work<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muzeum.sk/default.php?obj=galeria&ix=sngglf |title=Galéria Ludovíta Fullu Ružomberok /* Ludovit Fulla Gallery Ruzomberok /Muzeum.SK - múzeum, galéria, hrad, zámok/ |publisher=Muzeum.sk |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref> and [[Imro Weiner-Kráľ]] (1901 – 1978). The generation 1909 represent [[Cyprián Majerník]] (1909 – 1945), Ján Želibský, [[Ján Mudroch]] (1909 – 1968), Ladislav Čemický (1909 – 1968) and [[Ester M. Šimerová]] (1909).

Slovak [[graphic art]] experienced its peak during the 20th century. The most notable print-makers are [[Koloman Sokol]] (1902 – 2003), [[Vincent Hložník]] (1919 – 1997), [[Albín Brunovský]] (1935 – 1997), [[Dušan Kállay]] (1948), [[Vladimír Gažovič]] (1939), [[Karol Ondreička]] (1898 – 1961) or the young generation of artists Katarína Vavrová, Jozef Jankovič and Matej Krén.

===Literature===
{{Further|Slovak literature}}
For a list of notable Slovak writers and poets, see [[Lists of Slovak authors|List of Slovak authors]].

Christian topics include: poem [[Proglas]] as a foreword to the four [[Gospel]]s, partial translations of the Bible into [[Old Church Slavonic]], ''Zakon sudnyj ljudem''.

[[Medieval literature]], in the period from the 11th to the 15th centuries, was written in [[Latin]], Czech and Slovakized Czech. Lyric (prayers, songs and formulas) was still controlled by the Church, while epic was concentrated on legends. Authors from this period include [[Johannes de Thurocz]], author of the [[Chronica Hungarorum]] and Maurus, both of them Hungarians.<ref name=Phillips>{{cite book |title=The dictionary of biographical reference: containing one hundred thousand names, together with a classed index of the biographical literature of Europe and America|last=Lawrence Barnett Phillips |first=|authorlink=|year=1871 |publisher=S. Low, Son, & Marston |location=|isbn=|page=1020}}</ref> The worldly literature also emerged and chronicles were written in this period.

There were two leading persons who codified the Slovak language. The first was [[Anton Bernolák]] whose concept was based on the western Slovak [[dialect]] in 1787. It was the codification of the first ever literary language of Slovaks. The second was [[Ľudovít Štúr]], whose formation of the Slovak language took principles from the central Slovak dialect in 1843.

Slovakia is also known for its polyhistors, of whom include [[Pavel Jozef Šafárik|Pavol Jozef Šafárik]], [[Matthias Bel|Matej Bel]], [[Ján Kollár]], and its political revolutionaries and reformists, such [[Milan Rastislav Štefánik]] and [[Alexander Dubček]].

Famous globetrotter and explorer, count [[Maurice Benyovszky|Móric Benyovszky]] had Slovak ancestors.

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Slovakia}}

[[File:BratislavaSND2.jpg|thumb|right|The new national theatre building]]

'''Classical music'''

The most important Slovak composers have been [[Eugen Suchoň]], [[Mikuláš Schneider-Trnavský]], [[Ján Cikker]], [[Ján Levoslav Bella]], [[Alexander Moyzes]] and [[Dezider Kardoš]], in the 21st century [[Vladimír Godár]] and [[Peter Machajdík]].

'''Pop music'''

[[Popular music]] began to replace [[folk music]] beginning in the 1950s, when Slovakia was still part of [[Czechoslovakia]]; American [[jazz]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], and [[rock and roll]] were popular, alongside [[waltz]]es, [[polka]]s, and [[Csárdás|czardas]], among other folk forms. By the end of the 1950s, radios were common household items, though only state stations were legal. Slovak popular music began as a mix of [[bossa nova]], [[cool jazz]], and rock, with [[propaganda|propagandistic]] lyrics. Dissenters listened to [[Österreichischer Rundfunk|ORF]] (Austrian Radio), [[Radio Luxemburg|Radio Luxembourg]], or [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Slobodná Európa]] (Radio Free Europe), which played more rock.

Due to Czechoslovak isolation, the [[domestic market]] was active and many original bands evolved. Slovakia had a very strong [[Popular culture|pop culture]] during the 1970s and 1980s. This movement brought many original bands with their own unique interpretations of modern music. The quality of socialist music was very high. Stars such as [[Karel Gott]], Olympic, Pražský výběr (from the Czech Republic) or [[Elán (band)|Elán]], [[Modus (band)|Modus]], [[Tublatanka]], [[TEAM (Slovak band)|Team]] (from Slovakia) and many others were highly acclaimed and many recorded their LPs in [[foreign language]]s.

After the [[Velvet Revolution]] and the declaration of the Slovak state, domestic music dramatically diversified as [[Capitalism|free enterprise]] encouraged the formation of new bands and the development of new [[music genre|genres of music]]. Soon, however, major [[label]]s brought pop music to Slovakia and drove many of the small companies out of business. During the 1990s, American [[grunge]] and [[alternative rock]], and [[Britpop]] have a wide following, as well as a newfound enthusiasm for musicals.

'''Jazz'''

[[Peter Lipa]] (born 1943) is a well-known Slovak singer, composer and promoter of modern [[jazz]]. He is one of the main organizers of the "[[Bratislava Jazz Days]]" festival, which takes place in the capital city at the end of October each year since 1975. It is the biggest jazz venue in Slovakia.

[[Martin Valihora]] (1976), having been awarded a scholarship on the [[Berklee College of Music]] in Boston,<ref>{{cite news|title=Well-rooted musicians can stretch their styles|date=18 April 2011|work=[[The Slovak Spectator]]|quote=The festival is the "spiritual child" of Valihora, a graduate of Berklee College of Music in Boston, USA,}}</ref> he established himself as a part of the New York's jazz scene. He has been playing with the world's famous Japanese jazz [[pianist]] [[Hiromi Uehara]].<ref>{{cite news|title=The first (and only) name in jazz piano|date=5 December 2004|work=[[The Houston Chronicle]]|page=7 section:"ZEST"|quote=Hiromi&nbsp;... makes her Houston debut&nbsp;... with her trio, featuring electric bassist Tony Grey and drummer Martin Valihor}}</ref>

Other notable Slovak jazz players are [[Laco Déczi]] (1938) -  composer, jazz trumpeter, [[Marián Varga]] (1947) - composer, organ player

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Cuisine of Slovakia}}
[[File:SkalickyTrdelnik.JPG|thumb|right|Slices of [[Trdelník#Skalický trdelník|Skalický trdelník]] - a traditional sweet pastry from the town of [[Skalica]]]]

Traditional Slovak cuisine is based mainly on [[pork]] meat, [[poultry]] ([[chicken]] is the most widely eaten, followed by [[duck]], [[goose]], and [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]]), [[flour]], [[potatoes]], [[cabbage]], and [[milk products]]. It is relatively closely related to [[Hungarian cuisine|Hungarian]], [[Czech cuisine|Czech]] and [[Austrian cuisine]]. On the east it is also influenced by [[Ukrainian cuisine|Ukrainian]] and [[Polish cuisine]]. In comparison with other European countries, [[Game (meat)|"game meat"]] is more accessible in Slovakia due to vast resources of forest and because hunting is relatively popular. [[Boar]], [[rabbit]], and [[venison]], are generally available throughout the year. [[Sheep|Lamb]] and [[goat]] are eaten but are not widely popular.

The traditional Slovak meals are [[bryndzové halušky]], [[bryndzové pirohy]] and other meals with potato dough and [[bryndza]]. Bryndza is a salty cheese made of a sheep milk, characterized by a strong taste and aroma. Bryndzové halušky must be on the menu of every traditional Slovak restaurant.

A typical soup is a [[sauerkraut]] soup ("kapustnica"). A [[Black pudding|blood sausage]] called "jaternica", made from any and all parts of a butchered pig is also a specific slovak meal.

Wine is enjoyed throughout Slovakia. [[Slovak wine]] comes predominantly from the southern areas along the Danube and its tributaries; the northern half of the country is too cold and mountainous to grow grapevines. Traditionally, white wine was more popular than red or rosé (except in some regions), and [[Sweetness of wine|sweet wine]] more popular than dry, but in recent years tastes seem to be changing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slovakiasite.com/slovak-cuisine.php |title=Slovak Cuisine |publisher=Slovakiasite.com |accessdate=16 October 2010}}</ref> Beer (mainly of the [[pilsener]] style, though [[Dunkel|dark lagers]] are also consumed) is also popular.
